# My personal portfolio/blog

### The tech
I am porting over my portfolio site to a new format. It will be served by Jekyll, a static site generator.
This is partially to get experience with a different stack and partially to set up a blogging platform for future use.

I began with the "moon" Jekyll theme and have modified the site from there.
