Hi, I'm John. I love building things. I love to laugh. I love solving problems, working with a team, and learning new things every day.
I grew up in Seattle, lived in Florida, then discovered that Charlotte makes a great middle ground.


Why do I love coding?

1. It's where the practical and the creative collide.
2. It offers a new challenge every day.
3. You get to make cool stuff with nothing but your brain, a bunch of 1's and 0's, and regular conversations with google and stack overflow.
